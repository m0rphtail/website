[Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of intruded.net, previously hosted on leviathan.intruded.net.

What follows below is the original description of leviathan, copied from intruded.net:

```markdown
Summary:
Difficulty:     1/10
Levels:         8
Platform:   Linux/x86

Author:
Anders Tonfeldt

Special Thanks:
We would like to thank AstroMonk for coming up with a replacement idea
for the last level, deadfood for finding a leveljump and Coi for finding
a non-planned vulnerability.

Description:
This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit
of common sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no
idea that it'd be this hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't 
require programming abilities from the players. Hopefully we made an
interesting challenge for the new ones.
```

Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on `leviathan.labs.overthewire.org` through SSH on port `2223`.

Data for the levels can be found in the homedirectories. You can look at `/etc/leviathan_pass` for the various level passwords.

Leviathan was a mix between *reversing* and *misc* styled challenges and had beginner level difficulty, nevertheless it was very interesting to solve them.

**NOTE:** To avoid spoiling the passwords if you want to solve them on your own and also to prevent lazy people from just copying the passwords ***:p*** , I will replace the actual passwords with `P455w0RD`.

So, lets get started!

---

## Level 0 -> Level 1
To login to the first level use:

```markdown
username: leviathan0
password: leviathan0
```

Once you ssh in, and run `ls -la`
you can find a hidden `.backup` folder which contains `bookmarks.html` file.

```bash
leviathan0@leviathan:~$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  3 root       root       4096 Aug 26  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 root       root       4096 Aug 26  2019 ..
drwxr-x---  2 leviathan1 leviathan0 4096 Aug 26  2019 .backup
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root       3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root       root        675 May 15  2017 .profile
```

The file is big, containing about 1399 lines.
But just grepping the file with `password`, we get the password for the next level! 

```bash
leviathan0@leviathan:~/.backup$ grep "password" bookmarks.html
<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is P455W0RD" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>
```

---
 
## Level 1 -> Level 2

Once logged into `leviathan1` with the password we got in the last level, we can see that we have a file named `check`.

Running `file check` we get to know that it is actually an executable file

```markdown
check: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=c735f6f3a3a94adcad8407cc0fda40496fd765dd, not stripped
```

If you run the binary, it asks you for a password ***:(***

```markup
leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ./check
password: idk bruh
Wrong password, Good Bye ...
```

Reading through the banner that was displayed when we log in, we know that there are a few debugging tools awailable for us.

So I open the binary in radare2, seek to the main function and print the disassembly to get this.

--snip--
```

From this assembly code from the main function, we can see that the program runs a printf function at `0x0804857f` stores the value in `s1` and does a strcmp at `0x080485ae` with `s2`.
Looking at address `0x0804854d` we can see that the variable `s2` is assigned value `sex`.

So running the binary again and with `sex` as the password, we get a shell and now we can cat out the password for the next level!

```bash
leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ./check 
password: sex
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
P455W0RD
```

---

## Level 2 -> Level 3

In this level, the binary we have takes in a file name as an argument and prints the contents of the file.

After running the command `ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2` we find that first `access` function returns `0` for the file meaning we have read permission for it. Then the function `snprintf` writes a string consisting of `/bin/cat` and the file path. Then function `system` is called which displays the content of the file.

```c
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
__libc_start_main(0x804852b, 2, 0xffffd764, 0x8048610 <unfinished ...>
access("/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2", 4)                                = 0
snprintf("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"..., 511, "/bin/cat %s", "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2") = 39
geteuid()                                                                  = 12002
geteuid()                                                                  = 12002
setreuid(12002, 12002)                                                     = 0
system("/bin/cat /etc/leviathan_pass/lev"...ougahZi8Ta
 <no return ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )                                                     = 0
+++ exited (status 0) +++

```

`int access(const char *pathname, int node);`

`access()` checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname. If pathname is a symbolic link it is dereferenced.

The mode specifies the accessibility `check(s)` to be performed and `4` specifies read permission.

On diccess (all requested permissions granted), `0` is returned. On error (at least one bit mode asked for a permission that is denied, or some other error occurred), `-1` is returned.

```c
int snprintf(char * restrict dest, size_t n, const char * restrict format, ... );
```

The `snprintf()` function is similar to `printf()`, but writes its output as a string in the buffer referenced by the first pointer argument, dest, rather than to stdout. Furthermore, the second argument, n, specifies the maximum number of characters that `snprintf()` may write to the buffer, including the terminating null character.

The return value is the number of characters that woulf have been written if n had been large enough.

The access function has a vulnerability *TOCTOU* race (Time of Check to Time of Update). The programe calls the `access()`, then calls the `open()`. In the small time between the two calls, the file may have changed. A malicious user could substitute a file he has access to for a symbolic link to something he doesn't have access to between the 2 calls. 

So we create a file `symlink` with a symbolic link to `/etc/levianthan_pass/levianthan3`. But we cannot pass symlink with binary file, so we create another file space as different files and it will only accept the symlink. When the `system` function is called it will output the content in the file linked by `symlink`.

We pass symlink space with the binary file and the access function will accept the complete path of the file but /bin/cat will treat symlink and space as different files and it will only accept the symlink. When the `system` function is called it will output the content in the file linked by symlink.

## Level 3 -> Level 4

Level 3 has another binary in the home directory.

If we run it, it asks us for a password.

Then if the binary is run with `ltrace`. We can see that the input password is compared with `snlprintf`, so that must be the password; and infact it is!

![level3](/images/blog/levianthan/level3.png)

Now if we run the binary with `snlprintf` as the password, we get a shell and can read the password for the next level.

![level3](/images/blog/levianthan/level3_1.png)

---

## Level 4 -> Level 5

The binary for level 4 is in the `.trash` folder in the home directory.

If we run it, we get a bunch of binary text.

```bash
01010100 01101001 01110100 01101000 00110100 01100011 01101111 01101011 01100101 01101001 00001010
```

There are many ways to convert binary data into text, but the easiest way is to use an online converter like [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html).

Converting binary into text we get the password.

---

## Level 5 -> Level 6

There is a binary file `levianthan5`. Running it gives us an error saying `Cannot find /tmp/file.log`.

So we can try to make a symlink of the password file to `/tmp/file.log`; and the binary to get the password.

![level5](/images/blog/levianthan/level5.png)

---

## Level 6 -> Level 7

The binary file `levianthan6` asks us to pass a 4-digit code as an argument.

Let's open the binary with radare2 and analyze the code

```nasm

--snip--
```

We can see that at address `0x08048587` the `atoi` function is called. The `atoi` function converts a character string to an integer value.

Then we see that `$eax` is compared with `var_ch`.

If we look at address `0x0804854f` we see that `var_ch` has the value `0x1bd3` assigned to it.

We can convert the hex value into a decimal number like this:

```py
python -c "print(0x1bd3)"
```

Running this we get `7123` and this is our password. If we pass this as the argument to the binary, we get a shell and can read the password for the next level!

## Level 7

When we log into level 7 with the password we got previously, we are greated with a message *CONGRATULATIONS* !

![level7](/images/blog/levianthan/level7.png)
