## Enumeration

The obvious first thing to do is a nmap scan.
I ran scan with the `TCP SYN`, Service version enumeration options and outputed the result into files.

We can see that there are 3 open ports.
Looks like there is a webpage on port `80`, so that's what I'll look into first.

Opening the page in firefox, we see a dashboard

I'm a bit lazy to manually look at the different pages there might be in this webapp.
so I'll run gobuster to automatically do that. Gobuster will also find any hidden directories, if any.

After running gobuster, we see 4 different pages. The `capture/` redirects to `/data/13`.
So checking that page in firefox we see some data and a button to download pcap file.

## FootHold

Check the `/data/0` page and download the pcap file. If we open the file with wireshark we can see something intresting.

We can filter the capture file to show only ftp packets. we can see a username and password. nice!

## User Flag

Let's try to login via ssh with the username and password we got.

We are in. We can see the user flag now

If we try get to the `/root` folder, we dont have permission. we also can't run sudo, as `nathan` is not in the sudoers file.

## Root Flag

After a bit of enumeration we find that python has been running as root.
So we can try to get a root shell with python.

And that works, we are now root, we can see the root flag.
